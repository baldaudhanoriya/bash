On Ubuntu, you need to prefix a command with  sudo to run it with root permissions.
Windows file system is located at /mnt/c in the Bash shell environment.

$       represents standard user account
root    administrators account
~       represents a home folder
/       represents top of all directory
cd /    takes you to top of directory
cd      also takes you to home
cd ~    also takes you to home

    end:
        1. type exit
        2. type CTRL + d
        3. type logout

go into windows using mount:
    cd /mnt/c
    cd /mnt/d

browse through directory:
    mkdir first second  // make multiple directories
    rmdir first secons  // remove directories
    pwd                 // present working directory:
    ls                  // list storage, list files and folders
    ls -a               // show files starting with '.' (hiddden)
    ls -l               // list files,  use a long listing format
    ls ~                // list whats on home directory from different folder
    ls .txt             // wildcard list files ending with .txt
    cd                  // chage directory, with any followup it will take you to home directory
                            cd without any arguments takes home
    pushd               // takes you to a directory temporary
    popd                // brings you back from pushd

    if there is space in directory use \ before space or put whole directory name inside ''.
    permissions needs to be set x


file:
    touch abc.txt           // create file abc.txt or change 'updated' date of file the alredy exist
    nano abc.txt            // open file in edit mode
    cat abc.txt a2.txt      // read file
    more file1              // read from a file in chunks( use 'q' to stop)
    less file1              // smae as more but scrol through arrows
        history | less
    file file/folder        // returns type of file and few details about it
        file *              // all files and folder with details
    search
        locate file_name        // find a file 
        updatedb                // creates or updates a database used by locate
    cp source destination   // copy file to a directory or in a file
    mv old_file new_name    // rename a file
    rm file                 // delete a file
        rm file*            // wild card delete
    rmdir directory         // remove empty directory
    rm -r directory         // remove every thing from directory and then directory itself, r - recursive
    ls -al / > lout.txt     // write every thing to file
    change file attributes:
        r-read 4, w-write 2, x- execute 1
        permissions are for three types
            self, group, everyone
        chmod +x file_name  // change for everyone
        chmod 755 file_name // permissions using code

basic:
    which cmd               // looks for a cmd and tells where it is
    cal                     // prints calendar with current date
    history                 // returns last 1000 uniq command
    whatis                  // find information about cmd
        what is la
    apropos                 // get information about anything
        apropos time
        apropos dir
    man                     // get detailed information
        man time
